## Practice Exercises for Machine Learning Course


a) Write a function in Python that takes two vectors as input (weight and feature vector) and
returns the logistic regression prediction for that input. 


b) Write a function in Python that takes a vector of predictions and a vector of actual values as
input and returns the Logistic Loss. 


c) Write a function in Python that takes a vector of predictions and training data as input and
returns the Gradient of Logistic Loss. 


d) Write a function in Python that implements the gradient descent algorithm for logistic
regression. The function should take a weight vector, gradient of logistic loss and a stopping
criterion as input and return the optimized weight vector. 


e) Use the functions created in the previous parts to apply logistic regression on the Iris Dataset.
Use one vs rest approach to classify for each Iris flower species in the dataset.
